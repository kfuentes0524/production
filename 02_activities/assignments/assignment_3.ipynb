    "\n",
    "        - A simple processor that only scales numeric variables and recodes categorical variables.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    + Regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - A baseline regressor, which could be a [K-nearest neighbours model]() or a linear model like [Lasso](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) or [Ridge Regressors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ridge_regression.html).\n",
    "        - An advanced regressor of your choice (e.g., Bagging, Boosting, SVR, etc.). TIP: select a tree-based method such that it does not take too long to run SHAP further below. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Evaluate tune and evaluate each of the four model pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Select a [performance metric](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html) out of the following options: explained variance, max error, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), r-squared.\n",
    "    - *TIPS*: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        * Out of the suggested metrics above, [some are correlation metrics, but this is a prediction problem](https://www.tmwr.org/performance#performance). Choose wisely (and don't choose the incorrect options.) \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Select the best-performing model and explain its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Provide local explanations.\n",
