    "2. Ideally, it would be better to perform the rolling average calculation using Dask, especially if dealing with large datasets that do not fit into memory. Dask is designed to handle larger-than-memory computations efficiently, enabling you to leverage parallel processing. However, as of now, Dask has limited support for certain operations compared to Pandas, making some calculations easier to execute after converting to a Pandas DataFrame."
